	<p> Customer retention in marketing has long taken a back seat to acquisition. Now higher customer 
		expectations, changing business objectives, and a fluctuating economy are causing many brands to 
		make it a priority. As marketers place a greater focus on their customer retention strategies, we’re 
		examining which of those strategies are truly effective to cultivate loyal customers.</p>
	<h2>What is customer retention?</h2>
	<p> Customer retention is a measure of
		<a href="#">customer loyalty</a>
		and refers to how well a brand or company is 
		able to keep its customers returning over time. High customer retention rates mean that a majority 
		of your customers are repeatedly choosing to purchase your products or services, staying on a 
		circular journey known as the customer loyalty loop.
		<br><br>
		Retaining customers may mean convincing them not to defect to a competitor, or keeping them engaged 
		with your brand, product or service to prevent lapse and churn. There are a variety of customer 
		retention tactics and strategies that businesses use to encourage customers to return, including 
		customer relationship management, customer loyalty programs, loyalty offers and rewards. Some 
		companies even employ Customer Success teams that align the goals of the business with those of the 
		customer to build mutually beneficial relationships.</p>
	<h2>Why is customer retention important to every brand?</h2>
	<p>	Historically speaking, companies have often undervalued customer retention’s importance, instead 
		concentrating on customer acquisition in an effort to demonstrate growth to their stakeholders. 
		Research has shown that 44% of companies make acquisition the priority, while only
		<a href="#">18%</a>
		focus on retention.
		<br><br>
		However, these numbers may soon change as more brands and marketers recognize how critical customer 
		retention is to both revenue gains and long-term business success. Existing customers have a 70% 
		likelihood of making a purchase (vs. 20% for new customers), they buy as much as 31% more on average,
		and their customer lifetime value (LTV) is estimated to be 10x that of their first purchase. For 
		online retailers, more than 40% of their revenue is generated by just 8% of their customer base—the 
		customers who are most loyal.
		<br><br>
		It’s also typically less expensive to retain customers than it is to attract them. In surveys, 82% 
		of companies agreed that retention is far cheaper than acquisition. In fact, according to the 
		Harvard Business Review, it can be anywhere from 5x to 25x more expensive to acquire a new customer 
		than to keep an existing one.
		<br><br>
		Added to that, COVID-19 has completely changed shopping patterns and customer decision making. 
		Customers who once may have made decisions based on price or quality will now be considering 
		countless factors from personal safety to local regulations. This environment makes acquiring new 
		customers even more challenging and retaining existing ones even more critical.	</p>
	<h2>Measuring Your Customer Retention Strategy</h2>
	<p>	To build a strong retention strategy it is crucial to recognize your brand's strengths and 
		weaknesses. Measuring and setting goals against key metrics gives insight into how well your 
		strategy is working to retain customers. How customer retention is measured will differ from brand 
		to brand. While there are over
		<a href="#">10 Key Customer Retention Metrics You Should Be Using to Track</a>, 
		here are a few metrics to start a strong customer retention strategy:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Churn Rate:</strong>
			The churn rate will help visualize the percentage of customers who have stopped interacting with your business.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Customer Retention Rate:</strong>
			The customer retention rate will provide a glimpse into how many loyal customers you have provided business to over a set time period</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Existing Customer Revenue Growth Rate:</strong>
			This metric will measure the revenue generated from your customer success, retention and loyalty efforts.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Customer Lifetime Value:</strong>
			Use this metric to measure the amount of revenue generated by a single customer</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Building a Successful Customer Retention Strategy</h2>
	<p>	The best customer retention strategies are built on business goals and insight. They also rely on 
		turning new customers into loyal customers-and one of the best ways to do that is with dynamic offers.
		<br><br>
		It's essential now more than ever to recognize that customer loyalty is no longer assured, and 
		customers' traditional shopping habits have changed. They now have an infinite number of choices; 
		they expect personalization, need relevancy, and desire an emotional connection.
		<br><br>
		Dynamic offers use machine learning to analyze that data and provide a balance of highly-personalized 
		rewards and non-transactional actions the consumer can use or take, which then builds that data-driven
		relationship.
		<br><br>
		So, after you've created KPI's to work against and set goals to improve customer retention metrics, 
		make sure all decisions keep customers top of mind. Ensure you're setting yourself up to grow and 
		connect with modern consumers through their customer journey by implementing dynamic offers and get 
		ready to watch your customer retention strategy thrive.

		strategy, and discover how to make personalized offers scalable and smarter with Dynamic Offer

	<h2>7 Customer Retention Tactics Your Brand Should Use Right Now</h2>
	<p>	When developing your customer retention plan, focus on these key areas to keep customers coming back.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<h3>Build customer trust and long-term relationships</h3>
			<p>	Fostering customer trust requires a strategic focus on every aspect of the customer experience.
				To build lasting relationships, deliver relevance and value at every stage of the customer 
				journey.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Educate your customers</strong> 
					on the most effective use of your product or service, both before and after purchase.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Provide outstanding customer service with multiple service</strong>
					channels and fast, accurate responses that solve customer issues.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Develop a frequent communication calendar</strong>
					on all channels.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Offer convenience</strong>
					with features like fast shipping, free returns, and/or mobile pickup orders, like Starbucks’ Mobile Order & Pay.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Listen & empathize with your customers</strong>
					The practice of listening will increase customer retention. Through listening to customers you will 
					collect customer feedback that will enhance how you deliver customized experiences.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>And most importantly:</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Create a robust customer loyalty program</h3>
			<p>	Maybe your brand already has a loyalty program, but you’d like it
				to deliver better ROI. Or, perhaps you’re just expanding your retention efforts for the 
				first time. Either way, an effective loyalty program should contain these 3 elements at a 
				minimum:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Rewards that reinforce your core business goals:</strong>
					whether you want to encourage more visits, more trials or more incremental purchases, 
					make sure your program and rewards are structured to achieve that result.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Greater benefits for more valuable customers:</strong>
					create a tiered program where existing customers who spend more get more valuable rewards, 
					from accelerated earning to exclusive promotions.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Targeted offers and rewards that are highly relevant:</strong>
					use the capabilities of your MarTech stack to personalize your offers and rewards to customers' 
					interests and preferences.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Leverage your customer data</h3>
			<p>	Many lists of customer retention strategies mention the ubiquitous 
				customer feedback survey—but to retain customers successfully, you need to understand their 
				preferences and motivations without always having to ask. Collecting and mapping customer data 
				like transaction histories, customer service interactions and loyalty program data will help 
				you prevent churn and identify where customer wants and your business objectives intersect.	</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Re-engage customers using marketing automation</h3>
			<p>	Today’s marketing automation technologies can take on entire 
				marketing processes to simplify workflows for marketing teams. Re-engaging customers is one 
				of these processes. Instead of your marketing team needing to track which customers have 
				lapsed, a marketing automation solution that uses AI and machine learning (ML) can 
				automatically recognize when customers lapse and re-engage them with personally relevant content.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Measure customer lifetime value</h3>
			<p>	Customer lifetime value (LTV) is an estimate of the net profit 
				attributed to your brand’s future interactions with a customer. Understanding LTV can enable you 
				to shift from a short-term business strategy focused on next quarter’s profits to a long-term one 
				that values ongoing customer relationships.
				<br><br>
				The simplest way to calculate customer LTV is to subtract the amount you spent acquiring and 
				retaining a customer from the amount of revenue that a customer generates. You can also use an 
				online calculator, such as this one from WebFX, or this more complex option.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Personalize your communications and offers</h3>
			<p>	Use the customer data you’ve collected to make your marketing offers 
				and messages more personally relevant to your customers. There are 3 stages to mastering personalization:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Stage 1, Macro segmentation:
					</strong>
					lets you market to customers in large segments divided by factors like demographics
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Stage 2, Micro segmentation:</strong>
					creating smaller niche segments by combining demographic and behavioral data
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Stage 3, 1:1 personalization:
					</strong>
					each customer receives messaging and offers that are individually personalized for them.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>	The closer you get to stage 3, the greater relevance and value you will 
				deliver, and the more you will retain customers.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Surprise and delight with gamification</h3>
			<p>	“Surprise and delight” has become something of an overused 
				buzzword—but that’s because it works, and nowhere is that more evident than with gamification.
				Using game design to motivate customers is highly effective because it leverages people’s 
				competitive natures while at the same time lighting up the reward center of the brain.
				<br><br>
				A few of the game design elements you can use to integrate fun surprises into your customer 
				retention program include Points, badges, leaderboards, progress tracking, and reward tiers.
				Gamification is also easily tailored to your business goals. You can gamify just about any 
				interaction your customer has with your company, from purchases and reviews to social sharing
				and trying new products.</p>
